#Steps for use:
#(1)Export Benchling file as FASTA and put it in folder containing this code.
#(2)Rename FASTA file as original file name with '.txt' ending.
#(3)Find reference plasmid on Addgene and Export it into the same folder as FASTA file.
#(4)Assign 'plasmidName' in templateEqual.py to the name of the plasmid used on Benchling. 
#(5)Replace file names accordingly as 'addgenePlasmid' and 'benchlingPlasmid' in templateEqual.py.
#(6)Run code!
